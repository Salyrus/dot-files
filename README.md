# dot-files
Just a backup of my dot files.

I run Void Linux on my desktop. With no concern for battery life or performance impact, the configs in the void folder have a lot of flair, such as animations, blurred backgrounds, transparency, rounded corners, etc.

I run Artix Linux on my laptop. It is very weak and therefore all configs in the artix folder focus on maximum performance and battery life.

The common folder contains some other system configs which are identical between the two devices.
